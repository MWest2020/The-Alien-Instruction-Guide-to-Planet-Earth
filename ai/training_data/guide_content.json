You are now ready to explore Planet Earth â€” a slightly moist, oxygen-rich rock populated by bipedal mammals who have developed alarming levels of optimism despite overwhelming evidence.\n\nThis guide will help you avoid common mistakes, misunderstand key customs, and most importantly: survive.\n\nProceed with caution. Also, bring a towel. Trust us.",

Context is everything.\n- **Nodding** can mean \"I agree\", \"I acknowledge your existence\", or sometimes simply \"my head is too heavy for my neck today.\"\n- **Thumbs-up** is mostly positive, unless presented in certain countries where it is equivalent to challenging someone's ancestors to a duel.\n\nAlien Advice:  \nBefore attempting any gestures, simply stare blankly and let the Earthlings make the first move. They appreciate mystery.\n\nIf in doubt: wave slowly and back away.",
