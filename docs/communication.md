# Communication: Waving, Nodding, and Other Threat Displays

Humans communicate not only through vibrations in the air (known as "speech") but also by flailing various parts of their bodies at each other.

- **Waving a hand** may mean "hello", "goodbye", or "I am stranded in a body of water and require immediate assistance". Context is everything.
- **Nodding** can mean "I agree", "I acknowledge your existence", or sometimes simply "my head is too heavy for my neck today."
- **Thumbs-up** is mostly positive, unless presented in certain countries where it is equivalent to challenging someone's ancestors to a duel.

Alien Advice:  
Before attempting any gestures, simply stare blankly and let the Earthlings make the first move. They appreciate mystery.

If in doubt: wave slowly and back away.
