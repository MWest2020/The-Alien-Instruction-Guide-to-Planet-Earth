# Introduction: Welcome to Earth

Greetings, Interstellar Visitor!

Congratulations on surviving the bureaucratic entanglements of the Galactic Travel Authorization Department. You are now ready to explore Planet Earth â€” a slightly moist, oxygen-rich rock populated by bipedal mammals who have developed alarming levels of optimism despite overwhelming evidence.

This guide will help you avoid common mistakes, misunderstand key customs, and most importantly: survive.

Proceed with caution. Also, bring a towel. Trust us.
