# Flora and Fauna: Earth's Persistent Oxygen Machines and Furry Overlords

Earth is unusually saturated with mobile and immobile carbon-based lifeforms. For your safety (and amusement), we divide them into two categories: flora (plants) and fauna (animals).

## Flora: The Stationary Providers

Plants dominate Earth's landscape. They create breathable gases, hold soil together, and occasionally serve as ceremonial sacrifices (known locally as "houseplants").

Important Observations:
- **Trees** are revered as sacred monuments, vital oxygen producers, and also disposable furniture material.
- **Flowers** are used in complex rituals involving courtship, mourning, and apologies after domestic disputes.
- **Grass** is cultivated obsessively, cut weekly, and admired for precisely 15 seconds before being forgotten.

Alien Advice:  
Do not attempt to communicate with trees. Despite their status, they are notoriously bad conversationalists.

## Fauna: The Mobile Entities

Animals vary widely, from microscopic rage monsters ("mosquitoes") to lumbering organic tanks ("elephants").

Key Species to Note:
- **Cats**: Allegedly domesticated, these creatures have mind-controlled millions of humans through strategic purring and selective affection.
- **Dogs**: Highly loyal, overly excitable ground-sniffers. Most believe they are part of your family.
- **Birds**: Feathery noise-makers capable of both song and random aerial defecation.

Alien Advice:  
When in doubt, offer small food items. It works for both flora and fauna, and occasionally humans.

Warning: Certain fauna may view small aliens as potential snacks. Size up your opponent carefully.
